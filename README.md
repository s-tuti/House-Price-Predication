**Maharashtra's House Price Prediction**

I'd like to share my end-to-end Machine Learning project on predicting house prices in Maharashtra, India. This project was created as part of my learning journey, and I'm excited to share it with you!

**Project Goal**

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the price of a house in Maharashtra based on various factors such as location, size, amenities, and more. This model can be used by potential home buyers, sellers, and investors to make more informed decisions.

**Methodology**

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** I collected data on house prices from various sources and preprocessed it to ensure it was clean and consistent. This included tasks such as handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** I used Python libraries like pandas and matplotlib to explore the data and gain insights into the relationships between different features and house prices.
3. **Model Building and Training:** I trained several machine learning models using Python libraries like scikit-learn. I evaluated the performance of each model and selected the best performing one for prediction.
4. **Deployment:** I deployed the final model as a web application using Streamlit. This allows users to easily input their own data and get predictions on house prices.

**Key Learnings**

This project was a great learning experience for me. I learned a lot about the entire machine learning pipeline, from data collection and preprocessing to model building and deployment. I also overcame some new challenges, such as dealing with imbalanced data and improving model interpretability.
