# Maharashtra's House Price Prediction

Welcome to **Maharashtra's House Price Prediction** project! This end-to-end Machine Learning endeavor is dedicated to predicting house prices in Maharashtra, India. Created as part of my learning journey, this project aims to provide accurate price predictions based on factors like location, size, amenities, and more, benefiting home buyers, sellers, and investors alike.

## Project Goal

The goal is to develop a robust model capable of accurately predicting house prices in Maharashtra, enabling informed decision-making for stakeholders in the real estate market.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Data on house prices was gathered from diverse sources and meticulously preprocessed to ensure quality and consistency. This involved handling missing data, outliers, and categorical variables.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Leveraging Python tools such as pandas and matplotlib, thorough EDA was conducted to uncover insights into relationships between features and house prices.

3. **Model Building and Training:** Multiple machine learning models were trained using scikit-learn. The models' performances were evaluated, and the best-performing one was selected for deployment.

4. **Deployment:** The final model was deployed as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input their data and receive predictions on house prices seamlessly.

## Key Learnings

This project provided valuable insights into the entire machine learning pipeline, enhancing proficiency in data preprocessing, model selection, and deployment. Challenges such as handling imbalanced data and improving model interpretability were effectively addressed, contributing to a comprehensive learning experience.
